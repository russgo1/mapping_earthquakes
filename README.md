# Mapping Earthquakes

## Purpose
The purpose of this project is to map global earthquake data from the USGS for the past week of earthquakes (as of 1/15/2023). A page is built which displays an interactive map of the world with three options for map styles, a legend, and three layers which respectively display all earthquakes as circles, tectonic plate divisions as red lines, and major earthquakes as blue-tones circles. Layers may be toggled on and off for all map styles. Additionaly information on the magnitude and location of each earthquake is displayed when the user clicks on any circle.
